# wunzirow
We are given a file called ```wunzirow.wav```. With a quick listen, it's obvious that it is reading out 8 bits of binary data, 28 times. There are a couple python libraries that could automate the transcription, but loading the file into ```flixier.com``` and generating subtitles will work fine for a file this small. After manually transcribing the bit strings, I used the following program to decode it:

```
words = [
"01101001",
"01100011",
"01110100",
"01100110",
"01111011",
"01101111",
"01101110",
"01100101",
"01011111",
"01101111",
"01110010",
"01011111",
"01111010",
"01100101",
"01110010",
"01101111",
"01011111",
"01101001",
"01100100",
"01101011",
"01011111",
"00111001",
"00110011",
"00110100",
"01100001",
"01100011",
"00110011",
"01111101" ]

string = ""

for word in words:
    string += chr(int(word, 2))

print(string)
```

This successfuly gives us the flag.
